<h1>March Update</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
<li>Of the <a href="http://www.obstracker.org/">240 budget documents monitored across all 30 countries</a>, a total of 142 have now been published. This is a decrease of 7 from last month.</li>
<li>Of the 98 documents not publicly available, 39 were produced but not published, and 59 were not produced or published late.</li>
<li>21 budget documents from 15 different countries were published in March. This includes thirteen In-Year Reports, one Pre-Budget Statement, one Enacted Budget, three Citizens Budgets, two Year-End Reports, and one Audit Report. These documents are all available on IBP’s <a href="http://www.openbudgetlibrary.org/">Open Budget Library</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making progress</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.obstracker.org/status/Egypt">Egypt</a> published its <strong>Pre-Budget Statement</strong> for the upcoming 2015-2016 fiscal year. Egypt had not previously published a Pre-Budget Statement, which provides important details regarding the government’s macroeconomic assumptions used to set policy.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.obstracker.org/status/Niger">Niger</a> has published a <strong>Citizens Budget</strong> for 2015. This is the first Citizens Budget that Niger has produced, and the fourth budget document that the government has made publicly available since the OBS Tracker was launched.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work to be done</h2>

<ul>
<li>Both the <a href="http://www.obstracker.org/status/Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a> and <a href="http://www.obstracker.org/status/Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> have failed to publish an <strong>In-Year Report</strong> for Quarter 4 2014 before the deadline of 31 March 2015. In previous years, both governments have published Quarter 4 In-Year Reports, with full-year data, too late to be considered publicly available.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.obstracker.org/status/Fiji">Fiji</a> and <a href="http://www.obstracker.org/status/Ghana">Ghana</a> have not made their <strong>Enacted Budget</strong> for 2015 publicly available, even though it has been over three months since the Executive’s Budget Proposal was enacted by the legislature. This represents a step backwards in transparency, as the budget law for 2015 is not available to the public.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Month Ahead</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.obstracker.org/status/Nigeria">Nigeria’s</a> government has still not made the <strong>Executive’s Budget Proposal</strong> for 2015 publicly available, though it has already been submitted to the National Assembly. As budget has not yet been passed, now is the time for the government to make the document publicly available.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.obstracker.org/status/Tanzania">Tanzania’s</a> <strong>Audit Report</strong> for 2013-2014 has been completed and submitted to the Executive, but has not yet been published. The government has until 31 December to make this document publicly available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<ul>
<li>The current status page for each country now <a href="http://www.obstracker.org/status/Niger">includes comments for selected documents</a>. These comments provide additional information on documents and are only available in English or the language of origin/researcher.</li>
</ul>

<p>All publicly available documents can be accessed through the <a href="http://www.openbudgetlibrary.org/">Open Budget Library (www.openbudgetlibrary.org)</a>.</p>
